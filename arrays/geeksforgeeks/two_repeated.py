'''You are given an integer n and an integer array arr of size n+2. 
All elements of the array are in the range from 1 to n. Also, all 
elements occur once except two numbers which occur twice. Find the two repeating numbers.
Note: Return the numbers in their order of appearing twice. So, if 
x and y are repeating numbers, and x's second appearance comes before 
the second appearance of y, then the order should be (x, y).'''
