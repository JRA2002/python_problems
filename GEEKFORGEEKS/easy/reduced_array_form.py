'''Given an array with N distinct elements, convert the given array to a reduced form where all elements are in range from 0 to N-1. The order of elements is same, i.e., 0 is placed in place of smallest element, 1 is placed for second smallest element, and N-1 is placed for the largest element.

Note: You don't have to return anything. You just have to change the given array.'''
