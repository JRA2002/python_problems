'''You start with an array A of size N. Initially all elements of the array A are zero. You will be given K positive integers. Let j be one of these integers, you have to add 1 to all A[i], where i â‰¥ j. Your task is to print the array A after all these K updates are done.

Note: Indices in updates array are given in 1-based indexing. That is updates[i] are in range [1,N].'''

    while m <= k - 1:
        j = updates[m]
        for i in range(n):
            im = i + 1
            if im >= j:
                a[i] = a[i]+1
        m += 1
